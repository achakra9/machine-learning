# Basics of Machine learning

There are mainly four major categories of machine learning based on how they are trained:
    1. Supervised learning
    2. Unsupervised learning
    3. semisupervised learning
    4. Reinforcement learning

1. Supervised learning:
   i.   K-nearest neighbours
   ii.  Linear regression
   iii. Logistic regression
   iv.  Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
   v.   Decison trees and random forests
   vi.  Neural networks

2. Unsupervised learning:
   i. Clustering
      - K-means
      - DBSCAN
      - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
   ii. Anomaly detection and novelty detection
      - one class SVM
      - Isolation Forest
   iii. Visualization and dimensionality reduction
      - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
      - Kernel PCA
      - LOcally Linear Embedding (LLE)
      - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)
   iv. Association rule learning
      - Apriori
      - Eclat
